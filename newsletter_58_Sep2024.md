## Join our next Community Forum on 18 October

**On Thursday, 18 October at 15:00 UK time** ([in your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2024-10-18/15:00)), we are hosting our next Community Forum.

👉 **[Sign up to attend the Community Forum](https://forms.gle/A7xDEmkQydwegEB79)** (via Google form)

This is part of a series of community calls that bring together members of *The Turing Way* community - including people who have not yet contributed to the project!

Modelled off a political town hall event, this online session is an opportunity to better understand activities across the project, our governance process and how decisions are made.
Our aim is to leverage the expertise across our community, and we explicitly invite you to review our processes and recommend improvements.

We expect that the calls will be a mix of celebration, feedback, and opportunities to build connections with other organisations and initiatives around the world.

Save the date for our final Community Forum:
- Thursday 12 Dec (15:00 - 16:30) - [In your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2024-12-12/15:00)

## Practitioners Hub 2024 Cohort has officially launched!

We are delighted to share that 20 organisations have joined the 2024 cohort of the Practitioners Hub.
A kick off and official launch event took place in September, with first set of workshops on Stakeholder Management in AI.

*The Turing Way* Practitioners Hub is an extension of *The Turing Way* that engages and involves industry experts, called Experts in Residence (EiRs), from partnering organisations.
The 2024 cohort will host nearly 40 EiRs, information for which is shared in our website: https://www.turing.ac.uk/turing-way-practitioners-hub/eirs.

![Alt: A picture from the event with Malvika speaking to the attendees with one Turing Way banner on her right and BridgeAI banner on her left.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bk3A2xd0C.jpg)

*The launch event took place at The Alan Turing Institute in London on 24 September, with several participants joining in person and online.*

Slide deck from the kick off event is [shared on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/13860739) with an overview of the programme and some next steps.

## Missing Data Chapter in Guide for Project Design

Congratulations to Jack Breen, a Turing-Roche Community Scholar, who recently merged a new chapter on the Rick of Bias in Research into *The Turing Way*. 

The Risks of Bias in Research chapter builds on one of the focus areas of the Turing-Roche Partnership.
Jack highlights the relevant work of the Partnership and draws upon her PhD research, where she encountered challenges related to missing data.

[Read the chapter in our guides]( https://book.the-turing-way.org/project-design/missing-data) and learn more about the story behind the chapter on [X/Twitter](https://x.com/turingway/status/1838184085295862009), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7245010853391929344/?actorCompanyId=98381282), or [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@turingway/113186766141650281)

![Alt: Screenshot of Github page with button for 'Merge Pull Request' being clicked in real time, adding to the project.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bk_JnvECC.jpg)

Thank you to Vicky Hellon and Dr Tapabrata (Rohan) Chakraborty for reviewing the chapter.

*Note: The Turing-Roche Partnership's Community Scholar Scheme, led by Vicky, supports 10 PhD students to embed themselves within the partnership and develop a community project related to data science in health.*
