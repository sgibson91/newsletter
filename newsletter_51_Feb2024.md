# Community News and Updates

The image is drawn in shades of green, grey, and black: in a cartoon-like style. The garden contacts a toolshed in the far corner, with bushes that contain pie charts. There is a pond that contains ones and zeroes, like binary code. The phrase "thanks" is drawn on a flower label, that is stuck into a flower pot that has leafy green roots coming out of the pot.](https://i.imgur.com/AJgGmCn.jpg)

To disemminate outcomes from the first cohort of *The Turing Way* Practitioners Hub, we hosted a showcase event on March 6th.
Centered around the theme [Co-adoption of AI and Open Practices for Innovation](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/turing-way-practitioners-hub-showcase-event), this event featured expert panels, attendee-led discussions and showcasing case studies from the first cohort (resources shared [on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/the-turing-way-practitioners)).

It also marked the opening of a call for Expression of Interests, inviting organisations and Small and Medium Enterprises to participate in the second cohort, scheduled to commence in September 2024.

**[Register your interest](https://forms.office.com/e/nk4kXZ2Fnt)**.
 
We encourage you to read the newly published [meta case study](https://zenodo.org/records/10777730) to learn more and evaluate how you can represent your organisation in the second cohort.
For any further information, feel free to reach out to *The Turing Way* team.

There are lots of updates from the community from the past few months: everything from adding new collaborators to new chapters, project updates, to everything in between!

## Join us in Celebrating our 5 Year Anniversary!

Please join us in planning our 5 year anniversary, in this issue recently made my Malvika. Join the conversation in discussing how we should celebrate 5 years of our amazing community and project: https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3518

Kirstie also recently submitted a mini workshop for Collaborations Workshop 2024, where _The Turing_. Learn more on [the Github issue (#3551)](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3551).

## Update on *The Turing Way* domain name

Thank you for participating in the discussion related to *The Turing Way* domain (issue [#3266](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3266)).
We have gone ahead and reserved `the-turing-way.org`, transition to which will be supported by our Infrastructure Working Group.
If you are interested in joining the conversation and support the work behind the scene, please join the #infrastructure channel in our Slack Workspace.

## The 'Data Science Without Borders' Project

*The Turing Way* will be part of the Turing's partnership in the Wellcome Trust-funded [Data Science Without Borders' project](https://www.ena.et/web/eng/w/eng_4053430).

As part of the Turing team, Malvika Sharan joined Owen Reckham, Katrina Payne and Camilla Rangel Smith (our previous Translation and Localisation co-lead) in attending the project launch event in Addis Ababa, hosted by The African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC) and Africa CDC.

![13 Members from APHRC led by Agnes Kirraga, Wellcome Trust led by Lisa Murphy and the Turing posing for a group picture.

There are ](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJCao0n6T.jpg)

The project kick-off took place from 19 to 22 February, leading to insightful conversations with collaborators from Africa CDC, APHRC and Pathfinder countries: Armauer Hansen  Research Institute - Ethiopia, the Institute for Health Research, Epidemiological Surveillance and  Training - Senegal, Douala General Hospital - Cameroon; as well as technical partners alongside the Turing: London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and the Committee on Data (CODATA).
The Turing team presented a session ([slide deck](https://zenodo.org/records/10716363)) and discussed their roles in the project, highlighting the use of *The Turing Way* in capacity building, skills training and sharing best practices as learned from this project with the braoder community.

## Tune into SustainOSS to hear Malvika's discussion about _The Turing Way_!

![Screenshot shows "Sustain OSS" logo, with a light blue seedling and title "Sustain". Shows the timestamps of the podcast with the title "Malvika Sharan on The Turing Way"](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bklkedypp.png)

In December 2023, Malvika recorded a podcast about *The Turing Way* with Richard Littauer from Sustain OSS. 
The Sustain podcast brings together practitioners, sustainers, funders, researchers and maintainers of the open source ecosystem. We have conversations about the health and sustainability of the open source community.

# Book Updates ‚Äì new chapter alerts!

As always, we encourage you to take a look at our issues or pull requests to get involved with the project! 
There are plenty of chapters to get involved with, bugs to fix, and questiont o ask in the community.

Congratulations to two teams who recently published new chapters on Data Hazards and Electronic Lab Notebooks, respectively.

## Data Hazards

Shout out to all co-developers and reviewers of this chapter in the Guide for Ethical Research: https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/ethical-research/data-hazards

This chapter finds its roots in the work of Nina Di Cara and Natalie Zelenka, the creators of the Data Hazards Project and previous contributors to *The Turing Way* book. 
This chapter also collates information and knowledge gathered from Susana Roman Garcia and Ceilidh Welsh's experience hosting a one-day Data Ethics Symposium in March 2023.

The writing and reviewing process took months of discussion and review, involving members of the Data Hazards Team and *The Turing Way*, and is still a work in progress! 
If you wanted to get involved please check out some discussions on the chapter: https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3514

Learn more in our coverage on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/turingway/status/1762895253193797936), [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@turingway/112010345630597706), and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7168664523413921793).

## Electronic Lab Notebooks

Massive shout out to Richart Acton for drafting, and Esther Plomp and Danny Garside for reviewing this new chapter, now published in the Guide of Reproducible Research: https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-elns

This sub-chapter originated with a section that Richard Acton wrote for members of the HDBI research consortium. Many of the revisions and conversations about this chapter were discussed in this pull request: https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3466.

It covers the pros and cons of ELNs compared to paper notebooks; common problems when adopting ELNs; considerations of lock-in and how to minimise it; and archival function of lab notebooks and what ELNs mean for this.
It further discusses the potential for automations and integrations, provides links to resources to aid in selecting an ELN and highlights some open-source ELN and concludes with a call for open-standards development efforts!
