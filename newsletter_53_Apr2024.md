# Community News and Updates

![Alt: A handrawn image by Scriberia artist of a garden on a platform, connected by two paths presumably to other gardens. "Our Community" is written at the bottom in scripted text in white. The image is drawn in shades of green, grey, and black: in a cartoon-like style. The garden contains a toolshed in the far corner, with bushes that contain pie charts that a person with a computer is gardening. There is a person with a laptop pruning a tree that contains branches modeled to look like a grab. A person with a shovel is showing someone around the garden with a shovel, while another person is welcoming another person to the garden.](https://i.imgur.com/AJgGmCn.jpg)

There is a hand-drawn globe featuring markers and text bubbles in different geographies, connected by a pink dashed line as if communicating with each other. On the right side of the globe is a path where people are writing on computers and on paper, with the dashed line following them. The line continues to show a person reviewing text and writing, which converges into books. The flier holds information about Book Dash Applications.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkoH9hYJA.jpg)

The Turing Way Practitioners Hub is inviting Expressions of Interest (EoI) from organisations, small and midsize enterprises (SMEs) and industry experts engaged in data science and AI to work with us.

With a focus on implementing best practices in data science and AI initiatives in their own organisations, practitioners from various sectors will engage in this cohort-based programme between September 2024 and February 2025. 

**The deadline for registering your interest is 30 May 2024.**

üëâ **[EoI form for SMEs and Organisations](https://forms.office.com/e/nk4kXZ2Fnt)**

### EoI to join Network of Advisors 

We are also accepting interest from individuals to join our network of advisors who will engage with our project and cohort activities. 

Advisors will bring real-world expertise that can benefit small and medium enterprises interested in implementing best practices in data science and AI initiatives in their organisations.

üëâ **[EoI form for advisors](https://forms.office.com/e/UXSM17tKMV)**

Read more about the project to evaluate how you can contribute or participate in the second cohort - [visit our website](https://www.turing.ac.uk/turing-way-practitioners-hub).

## Join us at Collaboration Workshop for our Five Year Anniversary Workshop and Celebrations!

![Alt: Hanging multicolored banners with flags of different colors and designs](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Syk7nKCb0.png)

This week, *The Turing Way* community will be hosting a workshop celebrating 5 years with *The Turing Way* at Collaborations Workshop 2024 (CW24).

The Turing Way has long roots at Collaborations Workshop: we were first launched at CW19 as a lightly opinionated guide to data science! 

In line with CW24's theme, we will be facilitating a showcase and discussions on the topics relating code testing, environmental impact of digital research and inclusive events. 

Join us if you are planning to attend CW24, please do attend the workshop for a chance to join the shared reflection, a 'happy birthday' chorus and sharing a cake (for in person participants). üßÅ
Learn more on [the Github issue (#3551)](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3551).

Also, join the discussion on how we should celebrate 5 years of our amazing community and project: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3518](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3518)

## Watch back our April 2024 Community Forum

_Thank you for joining us on 23 April for our second Community Forum of 2024._ 

[You can now watch the recording on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFjXbvylGp8&list=PLBxcQEfGu3DkB1cLjSD5nEFvb_JkMPVqf)

This forum was organised with a renewed format planned by Kirstie and Malvika that brought people into breakout rooms to give space for deeper and smaller discussion of the presented plans. The slide deck, notes and links from this call are on Framapad (which will be archived on GitHub): https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/TTW-Forum-23April.

There are many people to thank for organising and facilitating this call
- Danny Garside for facilitating this call
- Jim Madge and Sarah Gibson for sharing about the Infrastructure Working Group (06:30)
- Malvika for sharing a proposal for a Communications Working Group (join us for the discussion on this proposal at the Collaboration Cafe on 15 May!) (20:20)
- Alexandra for presenting exciting updates about the Bridge AI and *The Turing Way* Practitioners Hub (don't forget that the Expression of Interest forms are open!) (32:05)
- Winny Nekesa for reminding us about the Book Dash deadline (43:16)
- Anne for providing tech and community support

Finally thank **YOU** (the cross-community pollinators üêù) for joining us -- it was wonderful to see many familiar and new faces! üíó 

Your inputs and participation are much appreciated in this new community space.
