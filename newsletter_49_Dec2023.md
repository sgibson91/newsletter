Dear _The Turing Way_ Community,

As we bid farewell to 2023, we're filled with gratitude and want to take a moment to express our heartfelt thanks to each one of you.  
  
We are continually humbled by the global footprint that _The Turing Way_ has acquired over the years. Thank you for your enthusiastic participation in Book Dashes, Fireside Chats, Collaboration Cafés and various trainings and workshops throughout this year. Your active involvement on GitHub, co-writing and co-creating chapters in our guides, as well as representing _The Turing Way_ in collective spaces and conferences have truly been instrumental in enhancing visibility and supporting the participation of our vibrant, international community.  
  
In 2023, we built on existing collaborations and explored new ones through discussions, events, chapters, sub-projects and new formats around emerging themes within the community. Our governance work continued to develop with close collaboration with the Core Team, ongoing important work of the Translation and Localisation working group and the further formalisation of Infrastructure and Accessibility Working Groups.

These past years have been a testament to our collective commitment to learning, growing, and sustaining our work in promoting and supporting a culture of open, reproducible, ethical, and collaborative data science. We're eagerly looking forward to what 2024 has in store for our project and community.

We send our best wishes to you for the new year and wish you all a restful and joyful holiday season.

See you in 2024!

_The Turing Way_ Team :sparkles:
