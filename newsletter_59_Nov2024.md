## Message from our Founder, Kirstie Whitaker

_This message was first shared on The Turing Way slack, at the October Community forum and discussed at the November Book Dash earlier this month. Kirstie shares this note below with the broader community and subscribers to our newsletter_

![Alt: Kirstie, a blond white woman, taking a selfie holding the mug. The back - now showing to the camera - reads "I'm making reproducibility too easy not to do!". Behind her is a painting of a sunset.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1Ub7snfJx.jpg)

Hi everyone!

After almost eight years at the Turing, I‚Äôm going to move on to explore other opportunities. My last working day was 1 November 2024, I'll be on annual leave until 31 December 2024, and then hand in my card and email address ready for new adventures in 2025.

I am so proud to have founded The Turing Way as part of the ¬£38.8 million AI for Science and Government funding in 2018.

Our 1000+ person global community have published more than 100 chapters to support improvements in practices related to reproducible research, project design, communication, collaboration and ethical co-creation.

Malvika Sharan is staying on as the lead investigator for the project on the Turing's side.

She'll continue to work with Anne, Arielle, L√©ll√© and many others at the Institute to serve our community as best they can.

I hope very much that this isn't goodbye from me though.
_The Turing Way_ has always been envisioned as a multi-stakeholder funded and community governed open source project.

I'm transitioning to being "just" a member of our community - with all the empowerment and opportunities that provides!
And I hope very much that I will build institutional and project connections to our work at a future role I take.

Thank you to everyone here who has influenced my knowledge, skills, perspectives and empathy.
I have learned so much during my time at the Turing and I‚Äôm going to miss the incredible TPS team terribly.

I hope I won't miss all of you though.
I'm loitering around slack even more than I used to!
Say hello there, or email me at kirstie.whitaker@gmail.com, and see me at future Collaboration Cafes soon üëã ‚òï ü§ó

## Book Dash's Community Share-outs Videos are on YouTube

![Alt: Two screenshots of ](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJhZe8fMkg.jpg)

_Screenshots from the two Community Share-out sessions_

**From 4 to 8 November, The Turing Way hosted its 12th Book Dash!**

The week was a busy one, consisting of 20 contribution sessions, 3 preparatory sessions and 5 social sessions distributed across at least 5 time-zones.

Thank you to the Book Dash Planning Committee that has been meeting for months to review forms, applications, schedules, access needs and other logistics to ensure that things run smoothly, and for hosting throughout the week.
Alexandra Araujo Alvarez, Anne Lee Steele, Arielle Bennett, Emma Karoune, Esther Plomp, Goodnews Sandy, Jennifer Ding, L√©ll√© Demertzi, Liz Hare, Patricia Loto.

Thanks also to Richard Acton and Kirstie for stepping in to lead a few sessions last minute!
Kirstie also facilitated discussions on *The Turing Way* governance and led the Share-and-Tell (English) session, which has always been one of the event's highlights.

The Committee is now hard at work writing up our report summarising the event - which will be released by the end of 2024. Meanwhile, you can watch these recordings:

# Updates from the October's Community Forum

At the last community forum, Kirstie Whitaker announced her departure from The Turing Institute, marking a significant transition for the project.
She emphasised the importance of the open and distributed leadership that has been modeled by several key members of our community, driving the project's successful adoption and use by different organisations beyond the Turing.
Presentations from Esther Plomp (TU Delft), Lena Karvovskaya (VU Amsterdam), and Carlos Martinez (eScience Center, Netherlands) highlighted how their leadership have led their respective organisations to support community engagement and the ongoing development of *The Turing Way*.

Watch the [recording on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gc4a0v0OzaM&feature=youtu.be).

Chaired by Arielle Bennett, Kirstie and Malvika shared plans to formalise and strengthen governance, reinforcing this federated model to encourage more organisations to support sustainable engagement with *The Turing Way*.
Over the next months, they will be engaging with community around this topic to co-create resources and examples to guide the evolution of our governance process.

## Project Delivery Team Update

The Turing Institute continues to support key roles required to supprt the community involvement, resource management and project maintenance: Malvika Sharan as Senior Researcher and project lead, Anne Lee Steele as Research Community Manager, and L√©ll√© Demertzi as Research Project Manager. 
Arielle Bennett will continue as part of the team in her new role as Senior Researcher, as described below.

### Arielle Bennett to Join The *Turing Way* Practitioners Hub Leadership

We are excited to share that Arielle Bennett has been appointed a Senior Researcher - Open Source Practices.

She will join Malvika in leading and overseeing the delivery of *The Turing Way* [Practitioners Hub](https://www.turing.ac.uk/turing-way-practitioners-hub) in the coming years.
*The Turing Way* Practitioners Hub collaborates with industry partners to promote best practices in data science and AI, focusing on open source, open data, and reproducibility. Arielle is leading the delivery of the second cohort, which includes 20 organisations, primarily small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

Arielle Bennett has been a core part of *The Turing Way* project delivery team for years, including in her previous role as a Programme Manager and an active contributor to the community.
You can read about her on our [Contributors' Record](https://book.the-turing-way.org/afterword/contributors-record#arielle-bennett).

## New Chapter on Bias in Research Data

![Alt: A person adding a new file on GitHub via a Pull Request, while another member reviews and approves it for them to merge it the the book.](https://i.imgur.com/Jg0IDWH.png)

Congratulations to Jack Breen, who led the development of a new chapter on Bias in Research that was recently merged into *The Turing Way*.
Jack is a PhD student at the University of Leeds, former Enrichment Student at the Alan Turing Institute, and a Turing-Roche Community Scholar.

In conducting a systematic literature review, Jack identified that high risks of bias in several research areas significantly limit the applicability of scientific findings to real-world scenarios.
With the objective of increasing awareness and understanding of these factors, this new chapter offers strategies to mitigate risks and enhance the reliability of results.

[Read the chapter in our Guide for Project Design](https://book.the-turing-way.org/project-design/risks-of-bias).

Thank you to Vicky Hellon and Dr Tapabrata (Rohan) Chakraborty for reviewing the chapter.
You can learn more about the story behind the chapter on [X/Twitter](https://x.com/turingway/status/1856664825922764833), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:share:7262433229805170688/?actorCompanyId=98381282), or [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@turingway/113186766141650281).
