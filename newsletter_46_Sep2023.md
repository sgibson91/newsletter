![Alt: A hand drawn scriberia image in pink and greyscale populate the right side of the digital flier. There is a hand-drawn globe featuring markers and text bubbles in different geographies, connected by a pink dashed line as if communicating with each other. On the right side of the globe is a path where people are writing on computers and on paper, with the dashed line following them. The line continues to show a person reviewing text and writing, which converges into books. The title says "Book Dash Applications are open! 13-17 November 2023, London, UK (and worldwide!)". Subtitle says: "Apply to: participate in a week-long event with The Turing Way community, meet other community members from around the world, join an ongoing project or team, Host a local hub within your university, city or region." Below in small text: "Have any questions about the application process? Email The Turing Way team: theturingway@gmail.com.

### Book your tickets for our Fireside Chat: **"Who is building open source AI"** (21 September 2023)

As part of [Open Source Initiative's conversations](https://opensource.org/deepdive/#cfp) about defining open source AI, *The Turing Way* is hosting a panel discussion that aims to center key communities who are building AI today, whose contributions are often overlooked. 
Through a conversation with panellists from content moderation, data annotation, and data governance backgrounds, we aim to highlight different kinds of contributors whose work is critical to the Open Source AI ecosystem, but are often left out of governance decisions or from benefiting from the AI value chain.  

We hope this multi-domain, multi-disciplinary discussion can emphasise the importance of centering the communities who are integral to AI production in conversations, considerations, and definitions of "Open Source AI." 

Invited speakers include: representatives from the African Content Moderators Union, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team and Cohere for AI's Aya initiative.

## Community Events

### New Dates - Workshop on Managing Open & Reproducible Computational Projects (14-15 September 2023)

[Julien Colomb](https://www.metis.hu-berlin.de/why_promote/julien-colomb/), [Jo Havemann](https://access2perspectives.org/team/jo-havemann/) and [Malvika Sharan](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/malvika-sharan) will be delivering the **Managing Open & Reproducible Computational Projects on 14 and 15 September from 9:00 to 12:00 BST** ([in your timezone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2023-09-14/09:00/Managing%20Open%20%26%20Reproducible%20Computational%20Projects)).

They will introduce best practices in data science project management and teach how to apply them to a computational research project. This is a pilot version of this workshop. Therefore, we are particularly seeking participants who would like to both learn and reuse materials to teach others about managing computational projects.

We have created 25 tickets, which will be allocated on a "first come first serve" basis. 

For any questions, please email turingway@turing.ac.uk
