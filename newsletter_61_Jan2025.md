## Embedding Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Accessibility Approaches in Data Science

Given the ongoing threats to Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (EDIA) programs and the forces working against these principles, it is crucial to reaffirm their purpose and restate our commitment to our community.
EDIA frameworks and initiatives address systemic barriers and expand access for marginalised communities, often enabling them to exercise their fundamental human rights.

From the start, *The Turing Way* has championed the role of EDIA in fostering inclusive communities and transforming the data science and research culture to be more collaborative and equitable.
As part of our mission to make data science open, reproducible, collaborative, and ethical, *The Turing Way* team stands firmly with the global open science community and all those striving to ensure that science and open science remains truly "open" to all.

As highlighted in the [Foreword](https://book.the-turing-way.org/foreword/embracing-digital-commons.html#foster-an-environment-for-diversity-of-knowledge-knowledge-producers-and-their-interests) section of the book:
> "Diverse members contribute to the development of *The Turing Way* guides, ensuring that EDIA principles are integrated into both the practices we share and the positive impact we aim for in data science."

We will continue to take proactive measures to cultivate an environment where diverse forms of knowledge, knowledge producers, and their interests can thrive.

We thank the rOpenSci Team for boldly reinforcing the mission of open science in their [latest blog post](https://ropensci.org/blog/2025/02/05/no-science-without-deia/).
> "The open in open source and open science means more than how we share code or data. It means knocking down the barriers to participation so that it is open and accessible to all, that everyone can join in the benefits and joys of science, and removing our blinders to the humanity of those we previously missed."

We extend their invitation to all to engage with this conversation.

## New Community Accessibility Policy to Further DEIA

Our new Community Accessibility Policy, published last December, will support access-centered approach for our community members, both in their participation in the community, as well as resources they share via *The Turing Way*.

![Alt: Screenshot of The Turing Way Accessibility Policy linked in the Community Handbook](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1YGbi1tye.png)

_You can read the Accessibility Policy [in our Community Handbook](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/accessibility/accessibility-policy) or on [Github](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/ACCESSIBILITY.md)_

This achievement culminates over two years of collaborative work, beginning in 2022.
Through numerous conversations, discussions, and revisions, including those at three Book Dashes, we prioritised involving diverse perspectives from the community and moved with the speed of trust. 

A huge thank you to all contributors: Alexandra Araujo Alvarez, Andrea Sanchez-Tapia, Arielle Bennett, Chi Zhang, Esther Plomp, Laurel Ascenzi, Harriet Sands, Jesica Formoso, Jim Madge, Léllé Demertzi, Malvika Sharan, Patricia Loto, Precious Onyewuchi, Richard Acton, Sara Villa, Saranjeet Kaur, Sophia Batchelor, and Tania Allard.

We invite you to read *The Turing Way* Accessibility Policy, and we hope it serves as a valuable resource for promoting inclusive approaches in *The Turing Way* and other open science communities.
