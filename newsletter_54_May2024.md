# Community News and Updates

![Alt: A handrawn image by Scriberia artist of a garden on a platform, connected by two paths presumably to other gardens. "Our Community" is written at the bottom in scripted text in white. The image is drawn in shades of green, grey, and black: in a cartoon-like style. The garden contains a toolshed in the far corner, with bushes that contain pie charts that a person with a computer is gardening. There is a person with a laptop pruning a tree that contains branches modeled to look like a grab. A person with a shovel is showing someone around the garden with a shovel, while another person is welcoming another person to the garden.](https://i.imgur.com/AJgGmCn.jpg)

## Our 11th Book Dash is Happening: 3-7 June!

Next week, we'll be welcoming more than 40 long-time and new contributors to our 11th [Book Dash event](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/bookdash.html).

This week of collaboration and contributions will be hosted online, with participants joining from more than six different time zones, as well as at two hybrid hubs in London and Amsterdam.

**While the application process to join the full event has closed, we are organising two open and community-wide events in 7 June 2024.**

üëâ **[Sign up to join](https://t.co/Z5SxjD8Rru)** ‚Äî _You will receive joining information for both the Share-Outs and Fireside Chat events._

The Book Dash event will close with two **Community Share-Out and Contributor Celebration sessions** at 11:00 and 17:00 London time (UTC+1).
These calls will showcase work from the Book Dash week, inviting collaborations from the wider community.

This time, we are also featuring a Fireside Chat as part of this Book Dash. Read more below.

## Fireside Chat on "Making Things More Accessible in Data Science"

![A fireside flyer for upcoming session on Making things more accessible in data science. Taking place on 7 June at 13:00 UTC. The event is hosted by The Turing Way and sponsored by Society of RSE, Speakers are Lynn Kirabo, Chirstopher Kurz, Liz Hare and Tania Allard.](https://i.imgur.com/voz3wtw.jpg)

## Thank you for joining us at our Five Year Anniversary Workshop at Collaborations Workshop!

![Alt: Hanging multicolored banners with flags of different colors and designs](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Syk7nKCb0.png)

Kirstie Whitaker led a workshop at the Software Sustainability Institute's annual event, Collaborations Workshop 2024. This event marked five years since the project was launched in 2019 at the Collaboration Workshop.

The workshop featured different aspects of *The Turing Way*, aligned with this year's theme of the event: Environmental Sustainability, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning tools for science, and Citizen Science. Slides have been shared on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/11098175).

Thank YOU for joining if you were there. If you missed it, we have a treat for you - we recorded a podcast with Peter Schmidt, who will be publishing this episode next week ([watch this space](https://codeforthought.buzzsprout.com/)).

Sophia Batchelor and Alejandro Coca-Castro presented talks on the inclusive event chapter (which was live-merged!) and the Environmental Data Science Book, respectively. Emma Karoune provided online facilitation to ensure a good hybrid experience for the attendees.

This event would not have been possible without Alexandra Araujo Alvarez and Anne Lee Steele, who were instrumental in setting up the celebration facilitation.
