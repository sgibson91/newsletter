## Join our next Community Forum on 12 July

On 12 July, we are hosting our Community Forums.

This is part of a series of community calls that bring together members of *The Turing Way* community - including people who have not yet contributed to the project!

Modelled off a political town hall event, this online session is an opportunity to better understand activities across the project, our governance process and how decisions are made. Our aim is to leverage the expertise across our community, and we explicitly invite you to review our processes and recommend improvements.

We expect that the calls will be a mix of celebration, feedback, and opportunities to build connections with other organisations and initiatives around the world.

Join our next Community Forum on 11 July ([in your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2024-07-11/15:00)).

## Thank you for joining us at our 11th Book Dash!

<img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/f7eba6e7-d071-4ee2-a9c1-8f77dd7cf2eb.jpg" alt="Cartoon-like sketch of a big yellow tree in the centre of image. A diverse group of people, all pictured within a yellow, green and orange colour scheme, including a person using a wheelchair and people from different backgrounds are watering and maintaining the tree with the help of 2 ladders. The title reads 'The Turing Way book dash.">

As always, it was an exciting week full of collaborations, conversations and community with *The Turing Way*.

This week, we had over 35 participants participate in 20 sessions, 2 share-outs, and 1 Fireside Chat throughout the week. Participants worked on 77 issues (resolving 34!) and 46 pull requests (completing 30)!

Participants worked on all sorts of topics, ranging from how to host drop-in sessions, to updating our infrastructure, to publishing licenses, updating infrastructure, and more.

[Catch up on our recordings for the Community Share-outs on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPIH-ryT8dA&list=PLBxcQEfGu3Dkpt90ft1UAz0rxIRhsRsUb).

Currently, the Book Dash Planning Committee is hard at work compiling our report from the event, which will be released soon. Stay tuned!

There is a hand-drawn globe featuring markers and text bubbles in different geographies, connected by a pink dashed line as if communicating with each other. On the right side of the globe is a path where people are writing on computers and on paper, with the dashed line following them. The line continues to show a person reviewing text and writing, which converges into books. The flier holds information about Book Dash dates and that the Book Dash Local Hub and Planning Committee Applications are open">

### OpenFest 2024

The Turing Way team will be joining OpenFest 2024, hosted by the University of Sheffield.  
The year's theme is "Towards an Open Research Culture: Establishing, Embedding and Facilitating the Culture/s and Practice/s of Open Research".

> To what extent, and in what ways, is the future of research culture open? What practices are and will be central in establishing and embedding a culture of research openness? What factors impede efforts to achieve an open research culture, and how best can researchers and other professionals address these? Our online symposium aims to create space for colleagues across the UK and internationally to explore these and related ideas.
