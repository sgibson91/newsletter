September 2025 - Bridging communities and open science

August has been a quiet month, full with opportunities to slow down and rest intentionally. Yet, we still have some news and opportunities to share with our community ‚òÄÔ∏è

Fireside chats, SSI fellowship and some important dates for the Turing Way project‚Ä¶ scroll down and have a look!  
  
One thing you don‚Äôt want to miss our is our next **Turing Way Community Forum**, happening on the 19th September at 15:00-16:30 UTC+1. Community Forums bring together members of *The Turing Way* community - including people who have not yet contributed to the project. Modelled off a political town hall event, these online sessions are an opportunity to better understand activities across the project and how decisions are made. Register [here](https://forms.gle/Uu1tgsGS6ZtyNZdV9) and participate!

Enjoy‚Ä¶ and keep the conversations coming!
