The last community forum of 2025 was a special one, featuring celebrations across _The Turing Way_ community to close out the year! ✨

Chaired by Malvika, we were joined by the the new cohort of Software Sustainability Institute Fellows, and celebrated our community members who were the HiddenREF nominees and winners. 
As always, working groups and community members also shared exciting updates about their work, and needs for the new year.

[Watch the recording on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxLRnl7PzSY).

Thank you for joining us in this new community forum format throughout this year. 

Community forums this year have allowed us to share insights, communicate updates, and invite collaboration on activities that shape our project and community.
We are excited to host more such sessions next year with a focus on improving our governance and sustainability plans as a project and community.

## Meet the 2025 class of Software Sustainability Institute Fellows!

🎉 **Congratulations to the Software Sustainability Institute's 2025 cohort!** 🎉

For over 10 years, the SSI Fellowship Programme has supported passionate individuals in research and software, empowering them as ambassadors of good practice to shape the future of research software. 

This year's cohort includes many community members and frequent collaborators with _The Turing Way_ community, working on a variety of important topics.

Congratulations Arielle Benett, Deborah Udoh, Ella Kaye, Esther Plomp, Jyoti Bhogal, Katherine McDonough, Nicky Nicolson and Rachael Stickland, among other fellows.

## Hidden REF Nominations for Working Groups

**Congratulations to the Accessibility Working Group and Infrastructure Working Group for being recognised as "highly commendable" in The Hidden REF's 2024 competition!**

Originally started in reaction to the [Research Excellence Framework (REF)](https://2029.ref.ac.uk/about/what-is-the-ref/) that has informed funding allocations across UK's higher education providors since 2014, the Hidden REF competition began with a competition held in 2021 to recognise all outputs for research.

The Hidden REF campaign has since showcased the diversity of research outputs in UK research, and the incredible people who work in hidden roles – from librarians to technicians, research software engineers to research administrators and managers – making vital-but-unrecognised contributions to research.

Nominations were submitted for our the Accessibility, Book Dash, Infrastructure and Translation and Localisation working groups to highlight the often invisible work they do in making our work more accessible, engaging, maintainable, and localised for different contexts, nominated under different categories.

Thank you to Alexandra Araujo Alvarez, Arielle Bennett, Batool Almarzouq, Brigitta Sipőcz, Danny Garside, Emma Karoune, Esther Plomp, Susana Roman-Garcia, Carlos Martinez, Jim Madge, Léllé Demertzi, Liz Hare, and Sarah Gibson for leading these efforts across the community working groups!

## Accessibility Policy

![Alt: Screenshot of the Turing Way guide, titled "Accessibility Policy of The Turing Way Community"](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJiK96-HJx.png)
_Screenshot of The Turing Way Accessibility Policy_

**After two years of continuous work with the Accessibility Working Group, our Accessibility Policy is now live!** 🤗 

This work began in 2022, when Liz Hare and Andrea Sanchez Tapia gave two talks about [Accessible Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARMs7C_wE04) at our November 2022 Book Dash.

Over the following year, this evolved into the creation of the Accessibility Working Group.
Throughout 2024, the Working Group has collaborated on various documentation for our Community Handbook and Guide for collaboration, as well as joined the Book Dash Organising Committee to develop accessible guidelines for contributions to the handbook.

The recently merged policy was reviewed by many community members over more the more than 1.5 year review process. Thank you to Alexandra Araujo Alvarez, Andrea Sanchez-Tapia, Arielle Bennett, Chi Zhang, Esther Plomp, Laurel Ascenzi, Harriet Sands, Jesica Formoso, Jim Madge, Léllé Demertzi, Malvika Sharan, Patricia Loto, Precious Onyewuchi, Richard Acton, Sara Villa, Saranjeet Kaur, Sophia Batchelor, and Tania Allard for your thoughtful engagement and feedback on GitHub [issue](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3145) and [pull request](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3581).

We encourage you to read our Accessibility Policy in the [ACCESSIBILITY.md file](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/ACCESSIBILITY.md) in our Github respository, or in the [Accessibility sub-chapter in our Community Handbook](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/accessibility/accessibility-policy).
We hope that this will be a resource for others building inclusive open science communities, and that this document will be a reference point as we continue to grow as open and accessible practitioners of open science.

## The Turing Way Practitioner's Hub event on "Open Source, Ethics & Innovation in AI" - 25 & 26 November

On 25 and 26 November, The Turing Way Practitioners Hub team—Malvika Sharan, Arielle Bennett, and Léllé Demertzi—hosted the "Open Source, Ethics & Innovation in AI" event. Part of the Innovate UK BridgeAI programme, the event welcomed speakers and participants, including the second cohort of Experts in Residence, who brought diverse perspectives on openness and ethics in AI from across various sectors.

* The keynote address was delivered by Chi Onwurah, MP (UK Parliament), who shared insights on how open source can democratize AI innovation, paving the way for a more inclusive and equitable future.
* Panels and workshops were hosted in collaboration with Turing members Aida Mehonic, Sofia Pires, Arcangelo Leone de Castris, and Christopher Burr. 
* External partners included Nicholas Gates (OpenForum Europe), David Pérez-Suárez (UCL), Jacob Green (oGov), and Mariangela Mihai, PhD (Western Washington University).
* A special thanks to Alexandra Araujo Alvarez and Dominica D'Arcangelo for coordinating and ensuring the involvement of InnovateUK and BridgeAI partners.

Finally, we extend our gratitude to our online and in-person facilitators: Punita Maisuria, Anastasia Shteyn, Cassandra Gould van Praag, Emma Karoune, David Sarmiento Perez, Dannae Smith, and Giulia Tomba.

Full agenda can be [found online](https://www.eventsforce.net/turingevents/frontend/reg/thome.csp?pageID=163051&eventID=388&traceRedir=2) and a report will be shared on [our webpage](https://www.turing.ac.uk/turing-way-practitioners-hub).

## Reflecting on 2024 of Gratitude and Resilience, and Looking Ahead to 2025

Dear The Turing Way Community,

As we reflect on 2024, we are deeply grateful for all of you. This year has been undeniably challenging, with economic instability, escalating political unrest, devastating climate events, and growing concerns over the ethical implications of AI, all of which have deeply impacted communities around us. These difficulties have tested us in various ways, but they’ve also highlighted the importance of support, resilience, and collaboration.

In the midst of these challenges, *The Turing Way* community members have shown incredible kindness, support, and solidarity to each other. Thank you for creating such an open, collaborative, and inclusive environment where people feel welcome and encouraged.

Whether through discussions in Collaboration Cafés, events, Slack, or GitHub, or improving access to The Turing Way resources, your contributions have made this community stronger.

This year, we continued our focus on open science, reproducibility, and ethical data practices, while also embracing the pace needed for important work like accessibility policy, infrastructure maintenance, and governance. Your role has been extremely valuable, especially in such a demanding year.

Looking ahead to 2025, we’ll build on our progress, deepening collaboration and conversations around culture change and governance that prioritise transparency, courage and inclusivity.

We are excited for what lies ahead and grateful to have you with us on this journey. Thank you for everything you've done and for your continued support.

We wish you a restful holiday season and look forward to seeing you in 2025!

With heartfelt appreciation,
Malvika and Anne
On behalf of *The Turing Way* Team
