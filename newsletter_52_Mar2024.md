# Community News and Updates

![Alt: A handrawn image by Scriberia artist of a garden on a platform, connected by two paths presumably to other gardens. "Our Community" is written at the bottom in scripted text in white. The image is drawn in shades of green, grey, and black: in a cartoon-like style. The garden contains a toolshed in the far corner, with bushes that contain pie charts that a person with a computer is gardening. There is a person with a laptop pruning a tree that contains branches modeled to look like a grab. A person with a shovel is showing someone around the garden with a shovel, while another person is welcoming another person to the garden.](https://i.imgur.com/AJgGmCn.jpg)

### What are Community Forums?

In 2024, *The Turing Way* team has started a series of calls called 'Community Forums'.
> "I voted for Forum [...] because it conveys a stronger vibe of a place to highlight contributions from the many to share with each other." - Liz Stokes 

Community Forums will bring together members of *The Turing Way* community - including people who have not yet contributed to the project!
Modelled off a political town hall event, these online sessions are an opportunity to better understand activities across the project and how decisions are made. 
Our aim is to leverage the expertise across our community, and we explicitly invite you to review our processes and recommend improvements. 
We expect that the calls will be a mix of celebration, feedback, and opportunities to build connections with other organisations and initiatives around the world.

*We thank you, if you joined in the voting to rename these calls to "Community Forum" [on Github](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3579).*

## The Turing Way is now listed as a Digital Public Good!

![Alt: The Digital Public Goods Alliance logo, a tilted outline of a navy blue box, with a bright sky blue corner. Next to the large logo is a screenshot of The Turing Way page on the DPG registry, showing information about the project.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1P-ZvFkA.png)

We are so proud to announce that *The Turing Way* is now listed as a Digital Public Good (DPG) by DPG Alliance! üéâüéâüéâ

### What are DPGs?

The United Nation's Secretary-General‚Äôs Roadmap for Digital Cooperation defines DPGs as open source solutions such as software, data and content that contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
*The Turing Way* is listed under 'content' type and for contributing to SDG Number 4: "Ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning".
Alongside other open source projects like OpenStreetMap and Ushahidi, we are delighted to join the DPGA registry: https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/.

Last year, *The Turing Way* was also included in [Civic Technology Field Guide](https://directory.civictech.guide/listing/the-turing-way) as a project that using technology for the common good.

## Applications are Open for Book Dash Attendees

![Alt: A hand drawn scriberia image in pink and greyscale populates the right side of the digital flier. There is a hand-drawn globe featuring markers and text bubbles in different geographies, connected by a pink dashed line as if communicating with each other. On the right side of the globe is a path where people are writing on computers and on paper, with the dashed line following them. The line continues to show a person reviewing text and writing, which converges into books. The flier holds information about Book Dash Applications.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkoH9hYJA.jpg)

The Turing Way Practitioners Hub is inviting Expressions of Interest (EoI) from organisations/small and midsize enterprises (SMEs) and industry experts engaged in data science and AI to work with us.

**The deadline for registering your interest is 30 May 2024.**

### EoI for SMEs and organisations (Experts in Residence)

We are inviting SMEs and organisations to join our second cohort of Experts in Residence (EiR). 
With a focus on implementing best practices in data science and AI initiatives in their own organisations, practitioners from various sectors will engage in this cohort-based programme between September 2024 and February 2025. 

üëâ **[EoI form for SMEs and Organisations](https://forms.office.com/e/nk4kXZ2Fnt)**

### EoI to join Network of Advisors 

We are also accepting interest from individuals to join our network of advisors who will engage with our project and cohort activities. 
Advisors will bring real-world expertise that can benefit small and medium enterprises interested in implementing best practices in data science and AI initiatives in their organisations.

üëâ **[EoI form for advisors](https://forms.office.com/e/UXSM17tKMV)**

## Podcast on Building Data Science Teams

![Alt: Screenshot of podcast player, featuring the Code for Thought logo (that has a microphone encircled by the 'o' of 'code'), and the Research Software Engineering logo. The title of the podcast is 'Building Data Science Teams - Alan Turing Institute Skills and Policy Award - Part 1')](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJ9m5z5yC.png)

Emma Karoune, in collaboration with Malvika and Alexandra, is working on a Skills Policy Award-funded research project: [Professionalising Data Science Roles](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/professionalising-traditional-and-infrastructure-research-roles-data).

Since March 2023, this project is being delivered as one of *The Turing Way* sub projects, drawing practices, sharing resources and collaborating with *The Turing Way* community in its efforts.

To make outcomes accessible in different formats, the project team has collaborated with Peter Schmidt, host of the Code for Thought podcast, to produce two episodes discussing different aspects of this work.

The first podcast featuring Emma, Aida Mehonic, Vicky Hellon, Luis Santos, Katriona Goldman, and Jonathan Yong from the Turing's Research Community Management, Research Application Management, Data Wrangling and Research Engineering Groups is out!

üéß [Listen to the episode: Building Data Science Teams](https://codeforthought.buzzsprout.com/1326658/14761258-en-building-data-science-teams-alan-turing-institute-skills-and-policy-award-part-i)

This podcast features different roles as part of the Turing's data science ecosystem, or as we call it, our 'Research Infrastructure Roles' in *The Turing Way*.
