*[Watch her video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDVrI1917hc) to learn more about Arya and her work with The Turing Way.*

üöÄ Meet Arya, our standout Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2023 intern hosted by the GSoC organization INCF!

Arya, a computer science undergrad from Kerala, India, worked with mentors Johanna Bayer and Malvika Sharan to enhance The Turing Way book's usability.

She improved a Python package previously developed in The Turing Way to update the User Interface and personalize the browsing experience based on user profiles. Under the 'pathway' feature, this package has been deployed and merged into the book. Read details in her [GSoC report](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/communications/GSoC-applications/GSoC-2023/2023-GSoC-Final-Report-arya.md).

Thanks, Arya, for your invaluable contributions! üëè

### Explore the new 'pathway' feature in The Turing Way book

With the growing number of chapters, we've leveled up your reading experience.

üåü Dive into curated content with four pathways tailored for Early Career Researchers, Project Leaders, Research Software Engineers, and Software Citation - browsable under the [pathway feature](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html#different-pathways).

Thanks again to Arya's work, a [Python package](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/project_management/2021-07-ux-funding-turing.md) was refined and customized, integrating community feedback. Shoutout to Johanna, Malvika, and the infrastructure working group for supporting this work ‚Äì now [merged into the book](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/3277)!

üöß Help us create more pathways for an even more effective Turing Way experience for you and your colleagues. Your input matters!

üìò From November 13 to 17, 2023, The Turing Way celebrated its 10th Book Dash, and it was nothing short of spectacular! Huge thanks to the 35 brilliant minds who joined forces, crafting 34 issues and 42 pull requests on a spectrum of topics ‚Äì from data hazards to project management, data feminism, academic-industry collaborations, mental health, accessibility, and beyond.

We had an in-person hub in London, but this Book Dash extravaganza wasn't confined to a single space.
We had online sessions spanning multiple time zones throughout the week, with special addition for America/Australia friendly time zones.

Kudos to the outstanding individuals who made this event extra special with special Book Dash sessions:

üåü Committee Champions: Arielle Bennett, Batool Almarzouq, Johanna Bayer, and Saranjeet Kaur ‚Äì hosting onboarding and GitHub training sessions.
üñãÔ∏è Creative Maestro: Jonny Heath, poet and creative writer, returned to host a Creative Writing workshop.
üåê Show and Tell Facilitators: Kirstie Whitaker and Susana Roman Garcia led 'Show and Tell' Lunch sessions in English and Spanish, opening the door for more multi-lingual sessions in the future.
üé® Illustrator: Calum from Scriberia brought ideas to life with beautiful illustrations (coming soon!).
üó£Ô∏è Social Discussion: Richard Acton delved into licensing, sparking a fascinating discussion with our attendees.

# In *The Turing Way* Orbit

## Principle Investigator for Data Study Group - Early Career Opportunity

Ever wished for a hackathon with a collaborative twist? Look no further! DSG, The Turing's flagship collaborative event, offers a uniquely collaborative experience.
Held multiple times a year, DSG events bring together postgraduate students and industry/government/third sector partners (Challenge Owners) for a deep dive into real-life data science problems.

For participants, it's a training ground buzzing with peer-to-peer learning. 
For Challenge Owners, it's an entry point to collaborate with The Turing, with the potential to catapult DSG outputs into larger research projects.

A unique opportunity is the DSG Principal Investigator (DSG PI) role, where early career researchers will take academic ownership of a specific challenge.
