## Tune into part two of the Code for Thought podcast

To mark the five year of *The Turing Way*, we collaborated with Peter Schmidt, host of the Code for Thought podcast, to produce two podcasts capturing our history. Tune into these recordings!

![Screenshot of podcast player, featuring the Code for Thought logo (that has a microphone encircled by the 'o' of 'code'), and the Research Software Engineering logo. The title of the podcast is 'Happy Birthday - The Turing Way Part 1'](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1ZcsJUYR.png)

*The Turing Way* was launched in 2019 during the SSI's Collaborations Workshop.
At CW2024 at the University of Warwick, UK, we had a big birthday party to celebrate the occasion. In this episode, part 1 of a 2-part series on _The Turing Way_, Peter sat down with Kirstie, Sophia Batchelor, Patricia Herterich, and Sarah Gibson‚Äîas well as Malvika Sharan and Anne Lee Steele after the event‚Äîto record a snapshot of their experiences working with *The Turing Way*.

We thank Peter for producing these podcast episodes to help us tell you our story.

## OSPOs for Good 2024

The second edition of the OSPOs for Good symposium was organised on 9th and 10th July 2024 at the New York City headquarters of the United Nations. 

This event gathered leaders from across the open source movement, with ambitions and strides for championing OSPOs as a global network for good.
OSPOs, or Open Source Program Offices have increasingly become a method of embedded open source ways of working and practices across organisations worldwide.

![David Perez Suarez, Malvika, Neil Chue Hong and Arielle standing next to a big dark navy background with the UN's sustainable development goals symbol, a multicolored ring with different multicolored lines encircling it](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyMw1kvFA.png)

Multiple members of The Turing Way team joined the OSPOs for Good meeting, connecting across many different parts of the open ecosystem.
Malvika and Arielle from *The Turing Way* project delivery team were joined by Neil Chue Hong from Software Sustainability Institute and David Perez Suarez, Research Software Engineer from University College London.

During the side event [What's Next for OSS](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/whatsnext4oss/) held at Microsoft Office, Malvika provided speed mentoring on open source community building and moderated a panel titled "Open Source Ecosystem Enabler - Digital Public Goods for Impact" with academic stakeholder.

Hosted by Linux Foundation, *The Turing Way* was a content partner for this event.

We thank OpenForum Europe and OSPO++ for inviting us to participate and contribute to these events.

## Catch up on CSCCE Tech Case Study

![Alt: White background with blue text that says: "CSCCE Tech Case Study: using bots in GitHub to support The Turing Way community."](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJesBeUF0.png)

In 2023, CSCCE hosted a series of community ‚ÄúTools Trials‚Äù that focused on tools commonly used for community management in open-source and open-source-supporting communities. 

After presenting at the CSCCEE "Tools Trials" calls, Danny Garside and Anne Lee Steele have been working with the CSCCE team to develop a case study about how _The Turing Way_ community uses bots to support the community. 

üìñ These case studies have now been released as a report: ["CSCCE Tech Case Study: Using bots in GitHub to support The Turing Way community"](https://zenodo.org/records/12118902).

## Submit to the Hidden REF Competition 2024 

![Alt: Black background with the phrase "Hidden REF" in white and red letters as the title. The subtitle "celebrating all research outputs and everyone involved in their creation" is below.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJgpVeIt0.png)

Submissions now open for the Hidden REF Competition 2024!

The Hidden REF was launched to raise awareness of the research outputs and roles that are vital to research but overlooked by traditional research evaluation. In the 2021 competition, _The Turing Way_ was highly commended in the Practices Panel. 

The deadline is 13th September 2024 - we strongly encourage you to take part in the competition if you work in research and want to raise awareness of your own work or the work of others.

Find out more here: [https://hidden-ref.org/hidden-ref-competition/](https://hidden-ref.org/hidden-ref-competition/)

## Apply for the Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship

![ssi-fellowship](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hy73-y_F0.jpg)

**Applications for the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) Fellowship Programme 2025 will be open from Monday 12 August to Monday 7 October 2024.**

An introductory Fellowship Programme Launch Webinar will be held on Thursday 22 August, from 11:00-12:00 (BST/GMT+1).
