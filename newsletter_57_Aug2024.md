## Join our next Community Forum on 3 October

On 3 October at 15:00 UK time ([in your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2024-07-11/15:00)), we are hosting our next Community Forum.

This is part of a series of community calls that bring together members of *The Turing Way* community - including people who have not yet contributed to the project!

Modelled off a political town hall event, this online session is an opportunity to better understand activities across the project, our governance process and how decisions are made. Our aim is to leverage the expertise across our community, and we explicitly invite you to review our processes and recommend improvements.

We expect that the calls will be a mix of celebration, feedback, and opportunities to build connections with other organisations and initiatives around the world.

# In *The Turing Way* Orbit

## Submit to the Hidden REF Competition 2024 

![Alt: Black background with the phrase "Hidden REF" in white and red letters as the title. The subtitle "celebrating all research outputs and everyone involved in their creation" is below.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJgpVeIt0.png)

Submissions now open for the Hidden REF Competition 2024!

The Hidden REF was launched to raise awareness of the research outputs and roles that are vital to research but overlooked by traditional research evaluation. In the 2021 competition, _The Turing Way_ was highly commended in the Practices Panel. 

The deadline is 13th September 2024 - we strongly encourage you to take part in the competition if you work in research and want to raise awareness of your own work or the work of others.
