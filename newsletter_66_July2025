## Fireside Chat Series has Kicked Off! Sign-up to Attend the Next One in July

This June, we re-launched our 2025 series of Fireside Chats covering different aspects of governance monthly. üî•

Thank you so much to Neil Chue-Hong, Simon Hettrick, and Riva Quiroga, for sharing examples and expertise on governance from institutional, volunteer-led and research communities. This session was co-designed and hosted by Oscar Seip and Malvika. Thanks to Sara Villa for providing support with online facilitation.

## Catch-up on our June Community Forum

In June's Community Forum, chaired by Jim Madge, we heard updates from different Working Groups. New this time were updates from Project Delivery Groups: Data Science Without Borders and Jupyter DEI projects that collaborate and contribute to *The Turing Way* as part of externally funded initiatives.

üëâ [Watch this Community Forum and Fireside Chat on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdpWr3Y0kac)

In the second part of this meeting, the first Fireside Chat took place to allow Steering Committee members to share about their personal motivation, vision and ongoing work as part of the Constitution-Level governance.  
This was the final Community Forum hosted by the Turing's Project Delivery Team led by Malvika.

## üì£ Final Call to Apply for the Next Practitioners Hub Cohort!

![Alt: Handdrawn sketch of the practitioners hub expert in residence - different people, gathering around The Turing Way logo, across different sectors represented by colors and icons.](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/b02bae58-f8f1-4d1d-b2eb-fd59b8abac16.jpg?w=960&fit=max)

*The Turing Way* Practitioners Hub invites UK-based organisations and small enterprises (SMEs) in data science and AI to submit Expressions of Interest for our second cohort of Experts in Residence (EiRs). As part of the InnovateUK BridgeAI, this cohort-based program helps organisations understand and adopt industry best practices in data science and AI.

üìù Apply via the [Expression of Interest Form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=p_SVQ1XklU-Knx-672OE-Uj-C3hMm35Mpp--L4Y4NlZUOUxYT1dTUUdLQUlTTEhXVjU3WlJETkc3NC4u&route=shorturl&utm_source=turingway&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=get-to-know-our-steering-committee-and-important). **The deadline is July 16, 2025.**

From September 2025 to March 2026, the final cohort of the Practitioners Hub under the BridgeAI programme will be offered.

Bringing together practitioners across agriculture & food production, construction & manufacturing, creative industries, transportation & logistics sectors, this will provide a forum for cross-sector collaboration, knowledge exchange, and strategic partnerships to accelerate AI adoption and best practices in open source, open data, cross-sector collaboration, research reproducibility, and ethical approaches. Learn more about this call and explore case studies from previous cohorts on the Turing website.

### New MyST Plugin for the Book's Pathways Feature

Since its inception in 2019, *The Turing Way* has grown in size with chapters that cover various aspects of data science practices, which are targeted to specific groups.  
To make navigation of this ever growing book easier, a ‚ÄòPathways‚Äô feature was introduced, co-created [in stages](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/pathways#transitioning-python-package-to-myst-plugin) involving collaboration with the Alan Turing Institute's Research Engineering Group, and as part of a Google Summer of Code project. Developed as a Python package, it was designed to improve content discovery (pathways) by preventing users (personas) from being overwhelmed with information that may not be immediately relevant.

Since the book now utilises MyST and JupyterBook2 infrastructure, a [MyST plugin](https://github.com/the-turing-way/myst-curation) was developed to implement the Pathways feature for simplifying the build process, while keeping it maintainable and reusable by other MyST and JupyterBook users!  
We thank Jim Madge for his work, in both previously supporting the maintenance of the Python package, and developing the MyST plugin.

üëâ [Learn more about the Pathways feature in the Community Handbook](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/pathways)

### New blogpost about Accessibility

Precious Onyewuchi, Community Manager of the Data Science Without Borders project is a member of the Accessibility Working Group and Book Dash Planning Committee.  
Precious recently wrote a post "The Ripple Effect: Accessibility in Everyday Life" for her personal blog, capturing her experience working with the Accessibility Working Group and thoughts from working in community spaces.

## Opportunities in *The Turing Way* Network

### Apply to JupyterCon 2025

![Alt: Flier for the JupyterCon conference, an illustration of three astronauts walking on a rocky grey surface with orange planets floating behind them.](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/7c6df95d-3b88-4025-a12a-e614e6a85184.png?w=960&fit=max)

This year, [JupyterCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/jupytercon/) will be taking place in San Diego, California from 3-6 November 2025.

The Jupyter ecosystem has transformed data science, scientific research, and education. It has shaped the way a generation of developers and scientists develop their workflows.

JupyterCon 2025 will bring together data scientists, business analysts, scientists, educators, developers, core Project contributors, designers, and tool creators for a three-day, in-person event to learn and connect about all things Jupyter.

We have been a big fan of the Jupyter ecosystem for a long time -- JupyterBook remains the backbone of *The Turing Way* project.

## So long, and thanks for all the fish (and community)!

It's hard to believe that this is my last time writing *The Turing Way* newsletter!

It's even harder to summarise three years of stewarding *The Turing Way* as Research Community Manager, other than to say that it's been a joy and a privilege to steward this wonderful community. As we continue to advocate for culture change in data science and research - I know this starts with nurturing an inclusive and accessible community from the ground up.

With this being said, I'm really excited to pass on this important community management work to the Community Management Working Group, a fantastic group of people who will be taking over this newsletter from here on out. I can‚Äôt wait to see what comes next.

If you're interested in joining, join the #community-management channel on slack to get started.

Please stay in touch! You'll find me over at [www.aleesteele.com](http://www.aleesteele.com) (or on Slack, of course).

Warmly,  
Anne
