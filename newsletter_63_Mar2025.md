* **Join us**: [**Respond via this form**](https://forms.gle/8pBdGb8vCpDASTrq9)!

At the [Community Forum in February](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRYOLF_stU4), we discussed our efforts to operationalise the Constitution Level Governance this year, building on previous years of work at the Community and Maintenance Levels (read about the [Three-Level Governance Model](https://book.the-turing-way.org/foreword/governance)).

At this Community Forum, we will share important updates, including changes in *The Turing Way*'s organisational affiliation, reflections from the first Steering Committee meeting and opportunities for building multi-organisational support towards community management. We will also invite interests in collaborating on long-term sustainability ideas, offering in-kind support, and identifying funding sources with our community members.

## Applications to join our May 2025 Book Dash

![Alt: A hand-drawn scriberia image in pink and greyscale populate the right side of the digital flier. There is a hand-drawn globe featuring markers and text bubbles in different geographies, connected by a pink dashed line as if communicating with each other. On the right side of the globe is a path where people are writing on computers and on paper, with the dashed line following them. The line continues to show a person reviewing text and writing, which converges into books. The flier holds information about Book Dash Applications.](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/20f02412-21f5-4c04-b4d9-9752cbc3bfb2.png?w=960&fit=max)

## The Dynamics of Paid vs. Unpaid Contributors in Open Source/Science: Share Your Feedback

Esther Plomp, a long-time community member, is designing a project to understand the dynamics of paid vs. unpaid contributors to an open source/science project.
As part of her Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship, she will be carrying out this project in collaboration with *The Turing Way*, engaging and inviting contributions the community members.

To kick off discussion on this project, Esther hosted the main room during the previous Collaboration Cafe (19 March) on [the ethical implications of this project in a community context](https://hackmd.io/@TycZoDDEQIq6yttGuqbuww/H1imL6kFyx).

* **Join this project**: As she begins the next phase of her research by sharing your feedback on [issue #3833 in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3833).

*Thank you, Esther, for the care and openness with which you are hosting these conversations. We look forward to learning more insights from your work!*

## Updates from *The Turing Way* Practitioners Hub Showcase Event

On 20 March, our Project Delivery Team, Malvika Sharan, Arielle Bennett and L√©ll√© Demertzi, hosted the final showcase event at Wellcome Collections (London & online) for the 2024-25 cohort of [*The Turing Way* Practitioners Hub](https://www.turing.ac.uk/turing-way-practitioners-hub), comprising of 20 companies with 40 Experts in Residence. This project is funded by InnovateUK - BridgeAI as part of the Turing's offerings.

The showcase featured engaging panels where Experts in Residence discussed how organisations, including SMEs, can leverage open source, open data, and ethical approaches to accelerate AI adoption across sectors.

A panel with Clare Dillon (CURIOSS), Agata Ferretti (IBM's AI Alliance), and Elena Samuylova (Evidently AI) also shared academic and industry networks and tech resources for upskilling organisations in AI. The overall event highlighted impactful collaborations in digital consulting, transportation, creative industries, architecture, health policy, public service innovations, and more.
These case studies, demonstrating the Hub's promotion of open practices, collaborative networks, and responsible AI for organisations of all sizes, will be [shared on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/the-turing-way-practitioners/records?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10).

Recordings will be available on our YouTube channel, and an expression of interest for the upcoming cohort will be announced soon. Watch this space!
